Welcome to the Orbital Vehicle Operations Handbook! The Handbook will
guide you through the basics of spacecraft operation and basic orbital
mechanics, in the context of spacecraft operation and flight.

This Handbook covers spacecraft components, orbital mechanics,
rendezvous and docking, aerocapture and reentry, and more. When you're
finished reading this Handbook, you will know how spacecraft
rendezvous with a space station, how capsules control their reentry,
the entire launch process, and more.

I hope this Handbook helps you understand orbital mechanics and better
appreciate the hundreds of thousands of hours that go into designing,
building, and flying any spacecraft or launch vehicle.
